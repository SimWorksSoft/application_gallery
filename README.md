### Mode Source in Broadband Simulations

By default, mode source calculates mode at central frequency of the specified frequency range and then injects this mode at all frequencies, which is very effective in single-frequency and narrowband simulations. However, in broadband simulations, mode-mismatch errors increase as frequency range expands. In this example, the multi-frequency field of the mode source will be demonstrated using a copper wire with a thin dielectric coating operating in the broadband terahertz range.

### 2D-Periodic Metallic Photonic Crystal Slabs

A black body is an idealized object that can absorb all external electromagnetic radiation without any reflection or transmission. As the temperature rises, the electromagnetic waves radiated by the black body are called black body radiation. Actual objects cannot completely absorb external electromagnetic radiation, so they are also called "gray bodies". The thermal radiation spectrum of a "gray body" can be altered by changing its geometry or the materials used. The ability to modify or tailor the thermal radiation profile of an object is of great importance in many areas of applied physics and engineering. It has been noted that periodic engineering of devices made of metallic and dielectric materials at the subwavelength scale can change the thermal radiation properties of the device. Based on the work of *Chan* et al., this case studies the thermal radiation of a photonic crystal obtained by periodically arranging a device made of metallic tungsten and a dielectric material with a refractive index of $\sqrt{5}$.

### Correcting Field Amplitudes for High-Q Cavities

The quality factor Q value is defined as the ratio of the center resonance wavelength to the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the resonance peak. The higher the Q value, the better the wavelength selectivity of the device, the steeper the output peak, and the higher the sensitivity of the device. Generally, in the simulation of high-Q resonant cavities, the field amplitude obtained is inaccurate. The reason is that the loss rate in the high-Q resonant cavity is slow. If the simulation time is not long enough, the field in the cavity will not decay to 0 at the end of the simulation. At this time, the amplitude of the mode field in the cavity needs to be corrected to obtain the final actual amplitude. This case constructs a photonic crystal resonant cavity structure to demonstrate how to correct the field amplitude when the simulation time of a high-Q resonant cavity is insufficient.

### Exciting the Surface Plasmon-Polaritons in Graphene

Graphene, with its excellent electrical, thermal and mechanical properties, has attracted extensive attention from scientific researchers since its discovery. The chemical potential of graphene can be regulated by methods such as voltage  or chemical doping. This property makes graphene highly versatile in the field of material-light interactions, particularly in relation to surface plasmons. Surface plasmons are electromagnetic surface waves in which the field energy is predominantly concentrated on the surface of a medium and decays exponentially in the direction perpendicular to the interface. By exciting surface plasmons, graphene significantly enhances its ability to interact with light.

You can use the `Directivity` analysis group to compute directivity.

### Multi-Mode Interference (MMI) Coupler

The Multi-mode Interference (MMI) coupler is composed of three parts: input waveguide, output waveguide, and multimode interference region. When the optical field is injected into the multimode interference region through the input waveguide, the interference between multiple modes produces a self-imaging effect. This effect causes periodic generations of one or more images of the input field along the propagation direction of the guided wave. As a result, the MMI can achieve optical wavelength division multiplexing/demultiplexing, power division, polarizing splitter and other functions by this effect.

### Organic Solar Cell with PC Structure

Organic solar cells (OSCs) have gradually become a research hotspot in the field of solar cells due to people's demand for clean energy and their advantages such as light weight, mechanical flexibility, and low manufacturing cost. How to improve its power conversion efficiency (PCE) is an urgent problem to be solved. One of the more commonly used methods is to add micro-nano structures for light trapping into the photoactive layer of OSCs to increase light absorption, thereby improving PCE. The photonic crystal (PC) structure is used in the photoactive layer of OSCs, which can enhance the light absorption of solar cells in specific wavelength bands. This case uses FDTD simulation to analyze the light absorption of an OSC with a 2D hexagonal-lattice PC structure.

### Photonic Crystal Optical Switch Using Line Defects

In recent years, the unusual dispersion properties of photonic crystals (PCs), including the superlens, self-collimation (SC), and negative refraction, have attracted more and more interest and become an active research area. The SC achieves collimated radiation with almost no diffraction effect when the incident light propagates along a particular direction of the crystal. Line defects in 2D PCs cause bending and splitting of the SC beam. In this example, the effect of “optical switching” can be achieved by altering the line defects (radius of the dielectric rod) in the photonic crystal.

Solar energy is a clean and renewable energy. Therefore, the photovoltaic application of solar energy has become one of the most dynamic research fields in recent years. Solar cell is a device that converts solar energy into electricity. When sunlight irradiates a semiconductor material with photovoltaic effect, electron-hole pairs (photogenerated carriers) are generated. An electric current can be produced by inducing electrodes at both ends of the solar cell. In this example, we simulate a planar silicon solar cell by FDTD to calculate the absorption of solar energy ($300−1100nm$) and further to compute the photon generation rate and the corresponding photocurrent.

### Reflective Color Filters

The human eye perceives specific colors in response to specific light spectra. Reflective color filters are used to selectively modulate reflection spectra to provide different color perceptions to the human eye. According to the study conducted by Yang et al., a reflective color filter base on a $Ni/SiO_2/Al$ asymmetric Fabry-Perot (FP) cavity was modeled and simulated. The $Ni$ layer exhibits a near-perfect absorption effect across the solar spectrum. If the appropriate thickness is selected, the $Al$ layer blocks light transmission. By adjusting the thickness of the $SiO_2$ intermediate layer, a reflection spectrum is achieved that allows the human eye to perceive vibrant colors with high saturation and brightness. This case demonstrates how to calculate the chromaticity coordinates related to the reflection spectrum, and further analyzes the color adjustment patterns of the color filter.

They found that even slight variations in the number of graphene layers and Fermi level may lead to significant changes in the resonant wavelength and modulation intensity. This case aims to simulate this tuning process in 3D FDTD.

### Whispering Gallery Modes of a Microdisk

The whispering gallery modes of a microdisk use the total internal reflection (TIR) of light to confine the light within the microdisk to achieve light enhancement. Simply put, when light propagates in a medium cavity with a high refractive index, the light will be completely reflected at the boundary of the medium due to the difference in refractive index between the medium cavity and the outside world. When the light travels around the boundary of the medium and returns to its original position, the light that meets the phase matching conditions will be enhanced. The whispering gallery mode of a microdisk has a high quality factor and a small mode volume, so it has important applications in many aspects such as optical detection, nonlinear optics, cavity optomechanics, and quantum optics. It is a frontier and popular field of current optical research. In this case, we hope to find the first- and second-order whispering gallery modes of GaN cylinders, reproducing the results in the paper *Room-temperature continuous-wave lasing in GaN/InGaN microdisks* written by *Tamboli* et al.
